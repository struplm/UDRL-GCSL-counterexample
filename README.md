# UDRL-GCSL-counterexample
Provides source for UDRL GCSL counterexample in stochastic environments

This repository contains the source code for the experiments presented in Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning Can Diverge in Stochastic Environments With Episodic Resets by Miroslav Štrupl, Francesco Faccio, Dylan R. Ashley, Rupesh Kumar Srivastava, and Jürgen Schmidhuber.

To produce the plots shown in the paper, first ensure you have python 3.8.0 installed and execute the following in a bash shell:

python counter.py

After execution has completed, following files should have been generated: monotony.png, RMSVE.png, supdist.png
